## Azure End To End Project
# Azure End-to-End Data Pipeline Project

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data pipeline architecture using various Azure services including **Data Factory**, **Data Lake Gen2**, **Databricks**, **Synapse Analytics**, and **Power BI**.

## ðŸ“Œ Components Used

- **HTTP Source**: Simulated or real-time data from external APIs.
- **Azure Data Factory**: For data ingestion.
- **Azure Data Lake Gen2**: Raw and transformed data storage.
- **Azure Databricks**: Data cleaning, transformation, and enrichment.
- **Azure Synapse Analytics**: Data serving and querying.
- **Power BI**: Final reporting and visualization layer.

## ðŸš€ Pipeline Flow

1. **Data Ingestion**: Data Factory pulls data from an HTTP endpoint.
2. **Raw Storage**: Data is stored in Azure Data Lake Gen2.
3. **Transformations**: Databricks notebooks process and clean the raw data.
4. **Serving Layer**: Transformed data is stored and queried via Synapse.
5. **Reporting**: Power BI connects to Synapse for real-time dashboards.
